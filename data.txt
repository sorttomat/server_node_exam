32 Over hill, over dale, 
2 Thorough bush, thorough brier, 
8 Over park, over pale, 
64 Thorough flood, thorough fire! 
32 I do wander everywhere, 
4 Swifter than the moon's sphere; 
2 And I serve the Fairy Queen, 
16 To dew her orbs upon the green; 
16 The cowslips tall her pensioners be; 
64 In their gold coats spots you see; 
8 Those be rubies, fairy favours; 
256 In those freckles live their savours; 
128 I must go seek some dewdrops here, 
4 And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
